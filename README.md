# üë®‚Äçüåæ Yield Farmers' Almanac
Yield farming has emerged as a massive new trend in DeFi but is hard to understand, follow along, and find the best opportunities, given the rapid pace of innovation and experiments.

The Yield Farmers' Almanac is a community-sourced reference for yield farming information, meant to be clear and accessible to all. ü§ó If the repo gets to 2000 stars and 2000 merged PRs, we'll distribute tokens retroactively to the contributors adding the best and most up-to-date content.
